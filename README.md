See examples on how to use.


**Required Julia packages:**
-CairoMakie (for live plotting)  
-ProgressBars (for progressbar in integrator)  
-Random (for noise and random initial positions, probably pre-installed)  
-Distributions (for noise and random initial positions, probably pre-installed)  
-LinearAlgebra (for doing linear algebra, probably pre-installed)
